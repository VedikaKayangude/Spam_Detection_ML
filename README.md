# Email Spam Detection Using Machine Learning

## Problem Overview

Spam emails continue to clutter inboxes with unwanted and often harmful content, including scams and phishing attempts. During my internship at Oasis Infobyte, I developed an email spam detection system using Python and machine learning.

**Project Goals:**

- Preprocess a large email dataset, cleaning and converting text for modeling.
- Extract meaningful features from email components like sender, subject, and body.
- Experiment with machine learning models such as decision trees, SVMs, and Naive Bayes.
- Evaluate models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
- Tune hyperparameters to improve model performance.
- Use cross-validation to ensure the model generalizes well.
- Consider real-world deployment and ethical concerns around data privacy.
- Identify challenges and propose future enhancements.

## Project Summary

Spam emails pose a serious problem by flooding inboxes with unsolicited and potentially dangerous messages. This project involved:

- Cleaning and preparing a sizable email dataset for machine learning.
- Extracting key features that help distinguish spam from legitimate emails.
- Training and comparing several machine learning models.
- Measuring performance with comprehensive evaluation metrics.
- Optimizing models through hyperparameter tuning.
- Validating the model’s robustness with cross-validation and test sets.
- Discussing how the model could be applied practically to improve email filtering.

This project provided valuable hands-on experience in applying machine learning to a real-world problem, improving email security and user experience.

## Conclusion

Spam emails are a persistent issue, but machine learning offers a promising solution. Our analysis showed that around 13% of emails were spam. Common spam indicators included words like “free,” “call,” and “now.”

Among the models tested, the Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier stood out with a recall accuracy of 98.49%, effectively identifying most spam emails. This project demonstrates that with good feature engineering and model selection, machine learning can significantly reduce spam, making email communication safer and more reliable.

Ongoing improvements can further enhance spam detection systems and help keep inboxes clean.
